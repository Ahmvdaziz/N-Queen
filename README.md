N-Queens Solver
This project provides a Python solution to the N-Queens problem, where the objective is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find all possible solutions and displays them in a readable format.

Problem Description
The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle in which you are given an N×N chessboard and need to place N queens on the board such that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Backtracking Algorithm: Uses backtracking to find all valid solutions to the N-Queens problem.
Visualization: Displays the solutions as chessboards with queens represented by 'Q'.
Interactive: Allows the user to input the size of the chessboard (N) and outputs the solutions.
Requirements
Python 3.x
No additional libraries required
